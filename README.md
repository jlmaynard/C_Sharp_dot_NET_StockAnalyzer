# C_Sharp_dot_NET_StockAnalyzer
C# .NET semester project for USF Software Systems Design course. I received an A+ in the course. 

Project utilizes .NET framework and custom C# code and XAML to implement a stock analyzer
using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) forms and candle stick finance quant charts. 

Uses API to Yahoo Finance and builds appropriate string. 

IDE = VisualStudio

Be sure to check out any and all images and PFD files. They give the visual meat to the project.
